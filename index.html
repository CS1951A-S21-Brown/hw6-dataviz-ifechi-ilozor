          <strong>How My Dashboard Answers The Questions</strong>
          <div>
            My dashboard dynamically shows the top 10 video games of all time
            or the top 10 video games for a specific year in the first bar chart,
            along with the sales for each of the games in the top 10.
            My dashboard also dynamically shows the genre sales broken down for
            each region in the pie chart, which, on hover, shows the genre title
            and sales for that genre (please hover before selecting a region).
            Finally, the second bar plot statically shows the top publisher for
            each genre along with how much of that genre that publisher sold globally.

          <strong>3 Reasons Why D3 Was Helpful</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>
              D3 allowed me to make high resolution charts that can't be achieved
              with less syntactically complicated resources like Matplotlib.
            </li>
            <li>
              D3 allowed me to easily include bright color schemes which make the
              visualizations more appealing and accessible.
            </li>
            <li>
              Because D3 is in Javascript, I was able to easily add interactivity
              to my dashboard, which makes it possible for one graph to answer
              a broad question.

          <strong>3 Reasons Why D3 Would Not Be The Best Data Visualization Tool</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>
              D3 is syntactically complicated so you need a lot more code to make
              a legible plot; D3 is not ideal for quick visualizations.
            </li>
            <li>
              D3 supports many complex chart types, so people may be inclined to
              choose a fancier plot over the plot that most clearly conveys the data;
              D3 is not ideal for datasets that should be visualized with simple charts.
            </li>
            <li>
              D3 is a Javascript library so it is not ideal for data scientists who
              don't know the language.

          Users with no visual disabilities will find this dashboard accessible and users
          who are blind or have certain types of colorblindness may find this dashboard more
          difficult to use. As discussed in "A Comprehensive Guide to Accessible Data Visualization",
          blind users rely on screen readers when navigating the internet, and my dashboard
          currently does not utilize alt text. Another thing this article touched on was how
          certain colorblind users see different palettes. I used contrasting color and text
          in an effort to be more accessible, but there are potentially users with certain types
          of colorblindness who may not see the contrast. Some actions that I could take to improve
          accessibility are including alt text, including the raw dataset in such a way that the screen
          reader can read it, and changing the design or chart type of the third plot so that it doesn't
          rely on a legend.
        </li>
        <li>
          The first stage of my design and implementation process was considering what chart types
          to use to answer the questions at hand. I opted for simple charts, which I think is generally
          a good protocol. However, there are definitely charts that could make my dashboard more accessible
          but, frankly, I was limited by my time and skill. With more time and experience with D3, I
          believe I could utilize chart types like Map or Circular Barplot. In the implementation stage,
          I could have taken steps to include alt text, but I didn't, as I was focused on basic functionality.
          The final stage was revision, and with enough time, I could add alt text or change chart types
          or include the raw data.
